Dear Students,

Please find below the recommended exercises for week 2.

1. Practice with the least-squares approach:

Two data files are uploaded to BrightSpace, particularly:
The recorded data (dependent variable, y) in the file "data_record.txt"
The location where the data is located (independent variable, x) in the file "data_location.txt"
Exercise: 
Fit a line to the data using the Least-Squares method (boils down to finding 2 coefficients, see exercise in class)
Fit a parabola to the data using Least-Squares method (i.e. find 3 coefficients)

2. Practice with numerical derivatives (at least 5 exercises) from the following source:

3. Practice with numerical integration (at least 5 exercises) from the following source:
